## rocksetta-gitpod-links
Just a github website of my gitpod links before I move them to my true website

Also testing if a Dockerfile can be loaded

just type 

gitpod.io/#


in front of any repository url (I will put it inside the url) like this to fully generate a gitpod

https://gitpod.io/#hpssjellis.github.io/rocksetta-gitpod-links/


Personnally I like snapshots which are saved gitpods not live generated, however the Dockerfile method has some flexibility that the snapshots don't

This website is at

https://hpssjellis.github.io/rocksetta-gitpod-links/



until it gets moved to the main website at

https://www.rocksetta.com/rocksetta-gitpod-links.html
